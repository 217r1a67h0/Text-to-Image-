# Text-to-Image-
The advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning has opened new frontiers in generating synthetic images from textual descriptions, a process that merges computer vision and natural language processing. This project explores an innovative approach to generate high-quality images from text inputs using a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The objective is to create a system that understands human language intricately and produces visual content that accurately represents the provided textual description, thereby achieving seamless and efficient text-to-image synthesis. Text-to-image synthesis is a challenging problem at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.
